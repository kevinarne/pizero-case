# Description
This is the design for a sandwich-style case for a Raspberry Pi Zero W.

# Components
1. 1 x top part from PiZeroCaseTop.svg
1. 1 x bottom part from PiZeroCaseBottom.svg or PiZeroCaseBottomMirror.svg
1. 4 x washers, all contained within PiZeroCaseSpacers.svg
1. 4 x M2.5 screws (length based on the thickness of your pieces)

# Notes
The mirrored version of the bottom was made to make it easy to wrap the grain if you use wood.
